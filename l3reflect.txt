When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When you're not on your computer or want some other person to contribute to your project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	because whatever's on GitHub is there for the public to view and use, but the local changes might not be the final product and we might want to make it available to the public as some sort of finished or at least runnable product.
	

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks - when you want to change something for yourself without affecting the original work
	clones - to clone a repository, usually to clone an offline version
	branches - to work on different things without them affecting each other

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	the benefit is that you can track if you're up to date with the version available offline or not, and it helps if you have different one on the online version.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	without git or github, collaborating would be very difficult as different files would have to be maintained and changes would have to be cheched manually and the organization would be a pain.
