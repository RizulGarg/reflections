What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A hidden .git file is created which starts tracking the files in the directory.
	You need to do it to start version-checking!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area allows us to prepare the files we want to commit.
	It is like a temporary choose to save to discard changes space.
